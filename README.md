## Modding support

The game supports asset modding, this means that all assets used by the game can be overriden via mods.  
When starting, the game will first load the /assets/core/ folder then, any other folder in the assets/folder. Any asset loaded by the core module can be overriden by giving an asset of the same type in another module the same name.

```
XXXXXX  
XS   X  
X XX X 
X XX X
X   TX
XXXXXX
```
 (the map itself)  
#### all map characters:  
    - X = solid wall  
    - S = level's spawn point
    - T = teleporter to next level
    - W = win
    - space = empty space

### Correct weapon file format:
